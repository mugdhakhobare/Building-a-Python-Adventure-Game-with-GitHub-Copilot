# Building-a-Python-Adventure-Game-with-GitHub-Copilot
In this project, I will build a text-based adventure game using Python and GitHub Copilot. The game will allow users to explore different locations, make choices, and complete a  simple quest, focusing on fundamental Python concepts such as variables, lists, loops, conditionals, and functions .
